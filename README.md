# Stitch (for Roku)

Stitch is a Roku channel that aims to provide an actively maintained, reasonably feature-complete Twitch experience while respecting Twitch's business model (ads, monetization, and the like).

Stich exists because Twitch does not presently have any official channel for Roku, despite [Roku being the most popular smart TV platform, with (as of early 2022), a 39% market share in North America and a 31% market share worldwide](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4547471-the-sleeping-giant-in-streaming-turning-roku-into-a-huge-2023-winner).

If you work at Twitch, go make an official Twitch app so I don't have to. If you want this one you can have it. (See [Authorship and License](#authorship-and-license).)

## Installation

## Contributing

If you are comfortable using the GitHub interface, you can report bugs or request features by opening a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/0xW1sKy/Stitch-For-Roku/issues). (Please check to see if your issue has already been reported before opening a new one.)

We are currently looking into integrations between GitHub and Discord in order to make this process easier for everyone.

In addition to issues, Pull Requests are welcome. All contributions must be made [under the Unlicense](./LICENSE).

## Authorship and License

Stitch began as a hard fork of [Twoku](https://github.com/worldreboot/twitch-reloaded-roku), due to that application's apparent abandonment. Since then Stitch has been almost completely rewritten.

Twoku was released without an explicit license, but, as a non-cleanroom rewrite, all subsequent contributions to Stitch are released [under the Unlicense](./LICENSE).

If license encumberance is an issue for you, you can compare [the final upstream commit to this repository](https://github.com/0xW1sKy/Stitch-For-Roku/commit/268187c63e1eaf3922f577a2dab6ccb6a2e089f8) to see what code is unclearly licensed.

While removing any residual upstream code is not a priority for Stitch, Pull Requests replacing unclearly licensed code with unencumbered code are welcome.

Stitch is released on a non-commercial basis and derives no revenue. If you work for Twitch, please feel free to use the license-unencumbered portions of this repository as the basis for an official Twitch app.
