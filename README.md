# ðŸ”® Twoku (for Roku)
An Improvableâ„¢ Twitch app for Roku. Still buggy, so feel free to suggest improvements (and code and features). Unfortunately, the code is very disorganized and messy because the original developers knew nothing about Roku development when they started on this.

Also, the original devs have not been very active with this project recently. So if you can contribute, please do. There are still many desirable features that have not been added (just go on the Discord).

## Discord
If you have any questions or comments (or phishing links):

## Contributing
If you have an idea (feature, etc.) that you would like to contribute (with code) to the project with, DM one of the developers on the Discord with your idea. Otherwise, if you just have an idea, post it in the ```#features``` channel on the Discord server. You can also just fork this repository as its up to date and implement the feature yourself.

## How to Install
### With Access Code
<em>As of February 23, 2022, the first two codes below no longer work because of Roku's shutdown of private channels. However, the third code below (Twoku Public) still works for us and many others. If that code does not work for you, try the manual developer install described below.</em>

~~Install with access code: TWOKU (https://my.roku.com/account/add?channel=TWOKU)~~

~~Beta version: TTWOKU (https://my.roku.com/account/add?channel=TTWOKU)~~

Twoku Public (should be available for users in Mexico and Brazil): C6ZVZD (https://my.roku.com/account/add?channel=C6ZVZD)

### Manual Developer Install
1. [Enable developer mode for Roku](https://blog.roku.com/developer/developer-setup-guide)
2. Log into your Roku from your browser using IP from previous step (http://192.168.x.x)
3. ZIP (into a ZIP file) all contents of this repo (you do not have to include README.md) (using 7-Zip, WinRAR, etc.). Do not include extra top level directories in the ZIP file, otherwise you may get the error: "```Install Failure: No manifest. Invalid package.```". Alternatively, you can download this ZIP file by clicking [here](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1oMOxn41NAAq8CxULCr7VJ-WwFSdvdQ5-).
4. Upload previous ZIP file in Roku Development Application Installer (step 2)
