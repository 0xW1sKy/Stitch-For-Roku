# ðŸ”® Twoku (for Roku)
An Improvableâ„¢ Twitch app for Roku. Still buggy, so feel free to suggest improvements (and code and features). Unfortunately, the code is very disorganized and messy because the original developers knew nothing about Roku development when they started on this. The goal was to get a somewhat functioning Twitch app for Roku as fast as possible (because they wanted to watch Twitch on Roku immediately). They basically hacked on it until it <em>just werked</em>.

Also, the original devs have not been very active with this project recently. So if you can contribute, please do. There are still many desirable features that have not been added (just go on the Discord).

## Contributing
If you have an idea (feature, etc.) that you would like to contribute (with code) to the project with, DM one of the developers on the Discord with your idea. Otherwise, if you just have an idea, post it in the ```#features``` channel on the Discord server. You can also just fork this repository as its up to date and implement the feature yourself.
