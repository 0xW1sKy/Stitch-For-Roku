## Contributing
If you have an idea (feature, etc.) that you would like to contribute (with code) to the project with, DM one of the developers on the Discord with your idea. Otherwise, if you just have an idea, post it in the ```#features``` channel on the Discord server. You can also just fork this repository as its up to date and implement the feature yourself.

## How to Install
<em>If you are in Mexico or Brazil the access code version might not work due to Roku's region restrictions. Instead, try to install the app manually. </em>
